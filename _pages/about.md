Welcome to my homepage!

I am a junior faculty member at the University of Bonn, Institute of Macroeconomics and Econometrics. 
I received my PhD in Economics from Goethe-University Frankfurt in 2022. I spent the academic year 2022-2023 at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) as a post-doc fellow.

I work on macro/public/labor, economics of education/human capital, demographic economics, and computational methods.

On this website you can find more information about me and my research - I'll be happy if you get in touch!
